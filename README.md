# Progressive Web Application

## Description

Progressive Web Application is a text editing application that will continue to run with a poor internet connection or even offline completely. As with all PWAs, this application will cache important information which allows the app to load and function without constant internet.

## Installation

Installation of Node.js is required to run this module. Additionally, The node packages express and mongoose must be installed.

## Usage

To start using the Social Network API, the server will need to be initiated. Since there are no seeds for this application, any test data will need to be generated by posting with an API platform such as Insomnia or Postman.

To start this application, type npm start into Terminal or Bash.
